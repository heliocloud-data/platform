# EXAMPLE instance configuration for a HelioCloud installation. A "typical" HelioCloud instance will be configured:
# - to create a brand new VPC, side stepping any issues with current VPC's lacking necessary subnets, connectivity, etc
# - with a specific domain prefix for authentication, matching the domain name of the institution doing the install
# - have all the available modules enabled
# - name its S3 buckets for the Registry after the institution doing the install

# Create a brand new VPC
vpc:
  type: new

# Configure per the domain of your respective organization
auth:
  domain_prefix: "edu.myorganization"

# Enabling all available HelioCloud modules

  registry: True
  userDashboard: True
  daskhub: True

# Registry buckets are named in association with your organization

                 "edu-myorganization-helio1",
                 "edu-myorganization-helio2"
               ]
