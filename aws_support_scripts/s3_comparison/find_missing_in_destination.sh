# script to compare inventories of 2 buckets. You will need to supply the manifest files
# from S3 inventory for both buckets along with the locations (bucket names) where the 
# manifest files were downloaded from. For example:

# > compare_buckets.sh <src_manifest file> <dest_manifest file>

# NOTE: you *MUST* run aws-mfa first in order to credential in as an AWS user with read access to
# the buckets OR run this script on an EC2 instance which has an IAM role which allows read access 
# to the buckets being compared.
