Title: Kerchunk
URL: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-fjSixN3awxaFHcVFgvnqsR4RmwquauJ/edit#slide=id.p1, https://github.com/fsspec/kerchunk, https://agu2021fallmeeting-agu.ipostersessions.com/Default.aspx?s=D8-E7-AB-FD-34-05-5D-2E-97-90-DA-10-DC-8C-83-7E
Summary: Kerchunk is a layer on top of fsspec to create Zarr-like metadata for non-Zarr HDF/NetCDF files. AGU poster has pre-process times of <2 min for Zarr and Kerchunk then data open times of 30 seconds, vs data open of 10 minutes for NetCDF4; Zarr required an extra 52GB of storage and Kerchunk 0.5GB.
Action: Essential read; suggests HDF obviates needs for reformatting to Zarr

Action: Essential-- easy for us to make test data sets (identical data in different formats)

Title: email from Conrad Schiff
URL: n/a
Summary: "No, but thanx for the article.  CDF was developed at Goddard in the 1970s, originally as Climate Data Format, but quickly generalized as Common Data Format[...] Just to confuse things, the file extension are also sometimes named *.cdf, and must be opened by their library <http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/index.html>[...]To distinguish CDF and netCDF, NetCDFs start with "CDF" whereas CDFs have the string "Common Data Format (CDF)" near the beginning (try the Unix strings command)."
Action: (great summary of file formats!)
