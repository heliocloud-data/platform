This folder contains the base components of the HelioCloud stack that are necessary for all other components to be installed and function.  They consist of:
- Standardized AWS IAM setup 
- AWS Cognito provisioning steps/scripts to setup Cognito for end-user authentication & authorization
- Public S3 bucket setup 
- HelioCloud instance registration (for participation in the greater heliocloud "network")

TBD:  Should the file registry also be placed under here?
